I, like tons of other people, have tried to start, and continuously contribute to a blog of my own. And failed, like tons of other people.

The problem isn&#8217;t time. The problem is motivation. And I haven&#8217;t found enough.

<div id="attachment_7" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://i0.wp.com/caffinc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sIMG_2869.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7" alt="Bali Trail" src="http://i1.wp.com/caffinc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sIMG_2869-300x225.jpg?fit=300%2C225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    A Balinese Trail Less Taken
  </p>
</div>

This, being my own site, seems like the perfect place to start again. Hopefully this time around I have enough to share, as I go through life, kicking, screaming, and learning new things along the way.
